# Analyzing-CIA-Factbook-Data-using-SQL

In this project, we will be working with data from the CIA World Factbook, a compendium of statistics about all of the countries on Earth. The Factbook contains demographic information for countries like: population - The population as of 2015. population_growth - The annual population growth rate, as a percentage. area - The total land and water area.

We will be working with SQLite in this project to explore and analyse the database.
